# [Machine Bias Risk Assessments in Criminal Sentencing](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing).

* What stood out to me most is the reliance we have as a society on technology. We base our judicial system on bias-riddled software that most don't even understand the inner workings of, which can have huge impacts on peoples lives. These are real world consequences that we need to consider when releasing software for public use, highlighting the desperate need for careful consideration in the industry.

* I did a project on this topic for another class once, so this article was very interesting to me! The ethics of algorithms and how they impact people's lives is not discussed enough between members of our industry. It’s disturbing how these tools, designed to make the justice system more “objective,” actually reinforce racial hierarchies and systemic oppression. At the same time, this article reminds me of the potential for resistance—by exposing these biases, we can challenge the systems that perpetuate inequality and push for a reimagining of how technology is built and used. There’s so much power in turning a critical lens back on the tools themselves, using technology not just to enforce, but to dismantle and rebuild. -- Kahmeeah Obey ([kahmeeah](https://github.com/kahmeeah))
